A Selenium Webdriver framework built with an interpretation of the page object model utilizing C# and Nunit.

Wraps many of the common features of Selenium such as finding elements, performing page actions in a syntax that reads like English and gives non technical stackeholders the ability to easily understand and contribute to the tests. 

Todo: Create additional page classes and associated mapping elements to interact with the elements of the page.

Still in development.

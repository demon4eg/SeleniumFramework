A Selenium framework built with an interpretation of the page object model utilizing C# and MSTest.

Built to be as easy as possible for non-technical users of the framework to be able to understand the test cases and create their own using language that reads just like English.

Todo: Create additional page classes and associated mapping elements to interact with the elements of the page.

Also currently only works with ChromeDriver.
